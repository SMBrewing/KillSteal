Dream Game

Boss token that you fight
Take turns rolling a D6 until it is dead
Roll of 1 is critical failure (lost health based upon sequential rolls)
Roll of 6 did 6 damage
Landing blow takes the boss token
You had a ton of gray tokens (20ish), red tokens (10ish), and blue tokens (8ish)
Tokens seems to be based upon what moves you could do, and your totally health.
You also had a draw pile
Players had oppertunities to retreat, but could have bad effects happen to them

Goal of the game was to get the most landing blows? It was competetive against your team, and you wanted to be the last one landing the blow in order to get the boss card.
Bosses had health ranging from 11 to 25
Bosses had a turn to deal damage
Bosses had special abilities
Players had special abilities
Players had different weapons (Sword, Magic, Crossbow, Telescope?)
And at some point we got attacked by a minon in a tank who told us not to take the creator's mouse
